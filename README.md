# Regime Based Quant Strategy Engine

A modular trading strategy engine that dynamically switches between strategies based on market regime.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project detects market conditions and automatically selects the most suitable trading strategy.

Instead of using one fixed strategy, the system adapts based on:

- Trend
- Range
- Volatility
- Mean Reversion opportunities

---

## ⚙️ Core Components

- Moving Average (Trend)
- RSI (Momentum / Overbought / Oversold)
- ATR (Volatility)

### 2. Regime Detection
Classifies market into:
- Trending

Using one strategy fails long-term.

This engine adapts — making decision logic smarter.
